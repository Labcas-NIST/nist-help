# ðŸ’½ðŸ”­ NIST Help Portal

This software implements a [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org)-based content management system with NASA-JPL style that provides through-the-web editable web pages, a CDE explorer, password reset, and other features for the [NIST-JPL collaboration featuring LabCAS](https://github.com/Labcas-NIST).


## ðŸ¤“Â Development

To run this software locally, you'll need:

-   Python 3.11 (not tested on any other version)
-   PostgreSQL 15 (16 could also work)
-   A search engine; either:
    -   OpenSearch 2.9â€“2.11 (preferred)
    -   Elasticsearch 7.17

You'll also need a copy of the current content database from `ddsa-labcas` if you want to experiment with the current content. Alternatively, you can also start from scratch.

Creating a database user:

    createuser --createdb --login --createrole unh

Regardless, begin by creating a database:

    createdb nisthelp

Next, run the following commands:

    ./manage.sh makemigrations
    ./manage.sh migrate

```console
$ createdb nisthelp
$ ./manage.sh migrate
$ ./manage.sh createsuperuser --username root --email your@email.com
```


## Transfering Production Content

A cron job runs `@weekly` on `ddsa-labcas` under the `ddsaops` user that runs `pg_dump` to get a dump of the content database. Meanwhile on `tumor`, a Jenkins job runs `@weekly` that executes `support/sync-from-ops.sh` to bring that SQL dump and the `media` folder from `ddsa-labcas` to `tumor`. 

You'll then need to run the following on the JPL laptop:

    cd nist-help
    support/sync-from-dev.sh

And finally you can then run

    support/devrebuild.sh

to rebuild everything.
