# -------------------

# and get a fresh one every time.

# Media Blobs
# -----------
#
# The blobs hardly change and some day there could be many of them. In that eventuality,
# we definitely take advantage of the thumbprinting (checksum) features of `rsync` in
# order to speed things up on subsequent runs.
